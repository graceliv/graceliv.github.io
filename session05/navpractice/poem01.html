	 <p>Father, this year’s jinx rides us apart<br>
where you followed our mother to her cold slumber;<br>
a second shock boiling its stone to your heart,<br>  
leaving me here to shuffle and disencumber<br>  
you from the residence you could not afford:<br>   
a gold key, your half of a woolen mill,<br>
twenty suits from Dunne’s, an English Ford,<br>   
the love and legal verbiage of another will,<br>   
boxes of pictures of people I do not know.<br>
I touch their cardboard faces. They must go.</p>

<p>But the eyes, as thick as wood in this album,<br>  
hold me. I stop here, where a small boy<br>
waits in a ruffled dress for someone to come ...<br>   
for this soldier who holds his bugle like a toy<br>   
or for this velvet lady who cannot smile.<br>   
Is this your father’s father, this commodore<br>
in a mailman suit? My father, time meanwhile<br>   
has made it unimportant who you are looking for.<br>   
I’ll never know what these faces are all about.<br>   
I lock them into their book and throw them out.</p>

<p>This is the yellow scrapbook that you began<br>
the year I was born; as crackling now and wrinkly<br>   
as tobacco leaves: clippings where Hoover outran<br>  
the Democrats, wiggling his dry finger at me<br>
and Prohibition; news where the Hindenburg went<br>   
down and recent years where you went flush<br>   
on war. This year, solvent but sick, you meant<br>   
to marry that pretty widow in a one-month rush.<br>   
But before you had that second chance, I cried<br>  
on your fat shoulder. Three days later you died.</p>

<p>These are the snapshots of marriage, stopped in places.<br>    
Side by side at the rail toward Nassau now;<br> 
here, with the winner’s cup at the speedboat races,<br>    
here, in tails at the Cotillion, you take a bow,<br> 
here, by our kennel of dogs with their pink eyes,<br>    
running like show-bred pigs in their chain-link pen;<br>    
here, at the horseshow where my sister wins a prize;<br>    
and here, standing like a duke among groups of men.<br>    
Now I fold you down, my drunkard, my navigator,<br>    
my first lost keeper, to love or look at later.</p>

<p>I hold a five-year diary that my mother kept<br>   
for three years, telling all she does not say<br>   
of your alcoholic tendency. You overslept,<br>
she writes. My God, father, each Christmas Day<br>   
with your blood, will I drink down your glass<br>  
of wine? The diary of your hurly-burly years<br>   
goes to my shelf to wait for my age to pass.<br>   
Only in this hoarded span will love persevere.<br>   
Whether you are pretty or not, I outlive you,<br>
bend down my strange face to yours and forgive you.</p>

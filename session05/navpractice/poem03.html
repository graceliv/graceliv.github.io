<p>I have gone out, a possessed witch,<br>   
haunting the black air, braver at night;<br>   
dreaming evil, I have done my hitch<br>   
over the plain houses, light by light:<br>   
lonely thing, twelve-fingered, out of mind.<br>   
A woman like that is not a woman, quite.<br>   
I have been her kind.</p>

<p>I have found the warm caves in the woods,<br>   
filled them with skillets, carvings, shelves,<br>   
closets, silks, innumerable goods;<br>
fixed the suppers for the worms and the elves:<br>   
whining, rearranging the disaligned.<br>
A woman like that is misunderstood.<br>
I have been her kind.</p>

<p>I have ridden in your cart, driver,<br>
waved my nude arms at villages going by,<br>   
learning the last bright routes, survivor<br>   
where your flames still bite my thigh<br>
and my ribs crack where your wheels wind.<br>   
A woman like that is not ashamed to die.<br>   
I have been her kind.</p>
